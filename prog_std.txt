This is an attempt to explain my odd programming standard used for this project.
Not to defend any of these but it's my default standard and it makes it easy
for me to read code.

Some files break these rules, they will be updated eventually.

try to make any file compile with c++ compilers

always put one var on a line by itself
  char* pvar;
  char text[256];
not
  char *pvar, text[256];

function calls look like this
  foo(a, b, c);
not
  foo ( a, b, c );

while, if, and case statements look like
  while (i != 0)
not
  while(i != 0)

for comments, always use /* */, not //

defines should always be uppercase

don't use tabs, use spaces

no line should exceed 80 chars

always use {} in if and while, even if it's only one line
  while (p != 0)
  {
    p = p->next;
  }
not
  while (p != 0)
    p = p->next;
